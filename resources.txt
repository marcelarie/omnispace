INCIDENTS
25/09 - I was editing my main.css file and there where no changes
        on the browser. Tired of searching on the web what was 
        happening finally I find that there where two main.css files
        one in the folder css/ and the other on the / root folder. 
        git hash:fb96192,7379668 

26/09 - JS script for dropMenu wasn't working because some propeties
        of CSS where causing problems. Here I started to use code
        from W3Schools.com git hash:18b465b, 7e79244

27/09 - Merged wrong master with develop, so all the files where
        deleted. I recovered evrything aborting and then the merge
        was successful. The only thing is that I wanted just a merge
        with the most recent commit and not loading all the commits.
        I will find out how to do that. git hash: 4b08c39
