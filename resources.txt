INCIDENTS
25/09 - I was editing my main.css file and there where no changes
        on the browser. Tired of searching on the web what was 
        happening finally I find that there where two main.css files
        one in the folder css/ and the other on the / root folder. 
        git hash:fb96192,7379668 

26/09 - JS script for dropMenu wasn't working because some propeties
        of CSS where causing problems. Here I started to use code
        from W3Schools.com git hash:18b465b, 7e79244

27/09 - Merged wrong master with develop, so all the files where
        deleted. I recovered evrything aborting and then the merge
        was successful. The only thing is that I wanted just a merge
        with the most recent commit and not loading all the commits.
        I will find out how to do that. git hash: 4b08c39

28/09 - I did a hard reset on Git and almost deleted a lot of commits. Fixed it 
        doing a git push origin HEAD:develop --force. uff..

28/09 - Contact page moved to the left. Need to fix it.

LESSONS
27/09 - Time is really important. The first days I tried to do all the code myself 
        but there were too many things in not much time. The best it's implement
        the code from the net understanding what the purpose of that code.

27/09 - To make your'e life easy you need to organize A LOT beforehand. :)
