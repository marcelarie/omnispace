This is a project made for the entry-challenge for [Assembler School](https://www.assemblerschool.com/).

The challenge was to create a business web page in 5 days. With multiple requierements and rules, [that you can see here](https://github.com/marcelarie/omnispace/blob/develop/resources.txt).  
At first, I was a little overwhelmed because it was literally my first time creating a web page.  
But if you try hard at the end it's always a reward. I learned a loooot with this project and it's 
just the beginning. 

After thinkig too much for something simple, I decided to make it about a fictional business 
mega-corporation that was the biggest on the Virtual Reality, but on the not soo distant future.
