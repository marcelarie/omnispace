This is a project made for the entry-challenge for Assembler School.

The challenge was to create a bussines web page in 5 days. With multiple requierements and rules, [that you can see here](https://github.com/marcelarie/omnispace/blob/develop/resources.txt).
At first I was a little overwhelmed because it was literally my first time creating a web page.
But if you try hard at the end its always a reward. I learned a loooot with this project and its 
just the beggining. 

After thinkig too much for something simple, I decided too make it about a fictional bussines 
mega-corporation that was the biggest on the Virtual Reality, but on the not soo distant future.
